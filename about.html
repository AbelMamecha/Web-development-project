            <h2>My KSU Journey</h2>
            <p> Greeting everyone, My name is Abel Mamecha and I am a sophomore attending Kennesaw State University. I started my first year as an architecture major however I have realized it was not meant for me. I decided to change my major and now I am majoring in Information Technology and plan on graduating early by taking summer classes. I want to build my skillset with client-server cloud computing for my future career.</p>
            <p> While attending school I work at a pizza shop part-time. I want to complete independent projects and gain cloud certifications to be able to obtain an internship this year.</p>
            <p> My goals are to gain my Bachelor's degree as soon as possible and work in the cloud for my career. I also have fitness goals I would like to meet. Hopefully with some discipine and hardwork I will reach my goals.</p>
